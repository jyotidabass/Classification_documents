AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THOSE CONTAINED IN SUBSECTION 4.3.3, SECTION 9.3 and
ARTICLE 12.

&lt;PAGE&gt;   5

                    (b) Contracts. Each Contract in Seller's possession
affecting or pertaining to the Real Property.

                    (c) Income and Expense Reports. Income and expense reports
showing the results of operations by Seller of the Real Property for the periods
1997 and 1998 to date.

                    (d) Plans, Approvals and Reports. All plans, specifications,
permits, licenses, approvals, and engineering or other consultants' reports,
tests and assessments, if any, pertaining to the development or improvement of
the Property, but only to the extent presently in Seller's possession or
control, and excepting appraisals, internal memoranda or valuation documents,
and any other proprietary or confidential documents.

            4.1.3. Termination of Existing Lease Option. Within One Hundred and
Twenty (120) days after the Effective Date hereof (the "Option Termination
Date"), Buyer shall have received a "Termination Agreement" between Seller and
the current lessee of the Property ("TRW"), terminating TRW's option to renew
the lease (the "TRW Lease") and containing no conditions or contingencies other
than payment to TRW of any compensation provided for in the Termination
Agreement. The Termination Agreement shall also include typical tenant estoppel
language to the effect that the TRW Lease is currently in force and TRW has no
claims or offsets against Seller thereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall Buyer be obligated to release TRW,
or indemnify or otherwise incur expenses or liabilities to TRW (other than the
Termination Costs) in connection with the termination of TRW's right to extend
the term of the Lease; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not in any
way affect any and all other rights and obligations between Buyer and TRW
resulting from Buyer's assumption of the TRW Lease at the Close of Escrow.
Additionally, Buyer shall have the one-time right to extend the Option
Termination Date for thirty (30) days. Seller shall not be in default under this
Agreement if Seller fails to obtain the Termination Agreement.

        4.2. Right to Terminate. With respect to each such condition, Buyer
shall give written notice to Seller, on or before the date specified above for
such condition, stating whether such condition is satisfied, unsatisfied or is
waived by Buyer. If any such notice states that a condition is unsatisfied, then
such notice shall state the reasons therefor in reasonable detail. Buyer's
failure to give any notice with respect to a condition shall be conclusively
deemed to mean that such condition is not satisfied. If Buyer notifies Seller in
writing, on or before the date for satisfaction of such condition, that any
condition is unsatisfied, or if any condition is deemed unsatisfied, then this
Agreement shall terminate. If this Agreement is so terminated, then: (i) the
Deposit shall be returned to Buyer upon Buyer's compliance with the provisions
of Section 4.4; and (ii) neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any further
obligations under this Agreement, except Buyer's obligation to perform the
"Continuing Obligations" (as defined in Section 4.5). If Buyer fails to deliver
Buyer's documents and work product to Seller in compliance with Section 4.4,
within ten (10) days after the termination of this Agreement, then Buyer shall
forfeit the Deposit and Seller shall be entitled to have the Deposit immediately
disbursed to Seller.

provisions of this Section 4.3, upon at least two (2) business days' prior
written or verbal notice, Seller shall allow Buyer (and its authorized
representatives and agents) reasonable access to the Property, during business
hours, for the purpose of making examinations, tests, analyses, investigations,
surveys, inquiries and other inspections in connection with Buyer's efforts to
bring about satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.1.
All of such examinations, tests, analyses, investigations, surveys, inquiries
and other inspections shall be performed by Buyer at Buyer's sole cost and
expense and shall be subject to such reasonable conditions as Seller may impose,
including a requirement that Buyer and its authorized representatives and agents
be accompanied by a representative of Seller while present on the Property.
Buyer shall conduct all such examinations, tests, analyses, investigations,
surveys, inquiries and inspections in such manner as will minimize any
inconvenience to the tenants under the Leases. In addition, Buyer shall have no
right to perform any borings, samplings, soils tests, groundwater tests or other
intrusive physical environmental audit procedures on the Property, unless
approved by Seller in Seller's sole discretion.

            4.3.2. Confidentiality. Buyer, and its agents, employees,
contractors and representatives, shall not disclose to any third party,
including any governmental or quasi-governmental authority, the results of any
examinations, tests, analyses, investigations, surveys, inquiries or other
inspections conducted by, or at the request of, Buyer on or regarding the
Property, except: (i) to the extent that Buyer is required to do so pursuant to
applicable law, provided that, prior to such disclosure, Buyer shall notify
Seller of Buyer's belief that Buyer is required to disclose such information;
and (ii) to those of Buyer's consultants who require such information in order
to perform the services for which they were retained, provided that, prior to
such disclosure, Buyer shall obtain, for the benefit of Seller, a written
agreement from each such consultant by which such consultant agrees not to
disclose any such information to any other person or entity.

            4.3.3. Indemnity. Buyer shall indemnify, defend, protect and hold
Seller harmless from and against any and all loss, cost, damage, injury, claim
(including claims of lien for work or labor performed or materials or supplies
furnished), liability or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) as a
result of the exercise of Buyer's (or its agents', contractors', employees' or
authorized representatives') right of entry pursuant to Section 4.3 or the
performance of Buyer's due diligence under this Agreement. Buyer shall promptly
repair any damage to the Property caused by its entry onto the Property.

        4.4. Buyer's Work Product. Upon termination of this Agreement for any
reason whatsoever other than a default by Seller hereunder, Buyer shall promptly
deliver to Seller all reports, plans, specifications, studies, drawings,
photographs, models, surveys, test results and other documents or work product
of Buyer, or its consultants, agents, employees and independent contractors,
either received by Buyer from Seller or any third person, or prepared by or for
Buyer, relating to the Property or in any way arising out of this Agreement, but
excluding (i) any confidential internal memoranda of Buyer with respect to the
Property, and (ii) any such reports or materials performed on Buyer's behalf by
third parties which, pursuant to their terms, are privileged, confidential or
proprietary. Buyer acknowledges that the above-described materials were prepared
by or at the direction of others and that Buyer makes no representation or
warranty of any kind with respect to the materials, including but not limited
to, their accuracy, completeness, or suitability for reliance thereon by Seller.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer's
delivery to Seller of all such work product shall be a condition precedent to
Buyer's right to obtain disbursement of the Deposit upon termination of this
Agreement.

        4.5. "Continuing Obligations". For purposes of this Agreement, the
obligations of Buyer which are set forth in Sections 4.3, and 4.4 are
collectively referred to as the "Continuing Obligations".

5. SELLER'S CONDITIONS PRECEDENT.

        5.1. Enumeration of Conditions. Seller's obligation to sell the Property
to Buyer shall be subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by Seller) of each of
the conditions precedent specified below in this Section 5.1.

            5.1.1. Termination of Existing Lease Option. On or before the Option
Termination Date, Seller shall have concluded a Termination Agreement with TRW,
in a form satisfactory to Seller in its sole discretion, containing no
conditions or contingencies and Buyer's Additional Deposit shall have been
released and applied to the Termination Costs, subject to the requirements of
Section 2.2.1, above.

        5.2. Right to Terminate. Seller shall give written notice to Buyer and
Title Company stating whether such condition is satisfied, unsatisfied or is
waived by Seller. Seller's failure to give such notice shall be conclusively
deemed to mean that such condition is unsatisfied. If any condition remains
unsatisfied as of the date specified above for such condition, then Seller may
terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to Buyer. In the event of any
such termination, the Deposit shall promptly be returned to Buyer and neither
Seller or Buyer shall have any further obligations under the Agreement, except
Buyers' obligation to perform the continuing obligations. Buyer's delivery of
Buyer's work product to Seller in compliance with Section 4.4 shall be a
condition precedent to Buyer's right to obtain disbursement of the Deposit upon
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.2; Seller shall
promptly give written notice to Title Company stating that such condition
precedent is satisfied following Seller's receipt of Buyer's work product as
provided in Section 4.4.



                                      -7-
&lt;PAGE&gt;   8

6. TITLE. Title to the Real Property shall be conveyed from Seller to Buyer by
grant deed (the "Deed"), subject to: (i) a liens for real property taxes and
assessments not then delinquent; (ii) matters of title respecting the Real
Property approved or deemed approved by Buyer during the Due Diligence Period;
and (iii) any other matters affecting the condition of title to the Real
Property created by or with the written consent of Buyer.

The foregoing exceptions to title are referred to collectively as the
"Conditions of Title". Conclusive evidence of delivery of title in accordance
with the foregoing shall be the willingness of Title Company to issue to Buyer,
upon payment of its regularly scheduled premium, its ALTA owner's policy of
title insurance, in the amount of the Purchase Price, showing title to the Real
Property vested of record in Buyer, subject only to the Conditions of Title (and
the standard printed exceptions and conditions in the policy of title
insurance). If Seller for any reason, other than an intentional default by
Seller (including any intentional encumbrance of the Property by Seller without
Buyer's prior written consent), is unable to deliver title to the Property
subject only to the Conditions of Title, then Buyer's sole remedy shall be to
terminate this Agreement and receive a return of the Deposit, and neither Seller
nor Buyer shall thereafter have any further rights or obligations under this
Agreement, except Buyer's obligation to perform the Continuing Obligations.
Buyer shall have no right to commence any action for damages, specific
performance or other relief as a result of Seller's inability to deliver title
to the Property subject only to the Conditions of Title.

7. DAMAGE, DESTRUCTION OR TAKING AND OPERATION.

        7.1. Damage and Destruction. If at any time prior to the Closing, Seller
determines that the Real Property has been destroyed or damaged by earthquake,
flood or other casualty and that such damage will require more than
$1,000,000.00 to repair (a "Casualty"), or if a proceeding is instituted for the
taking of all or any material portion of the Real Property under the power of
eminent domain (a "Taking"), then Buyer shall have the right by giving written
notice to Seller and Title Company within thirty (30) days after the date of
receipt of written notice of any such Casualty or Taking, either to: (i)
consummate the purchase of the Property in accordance with this Agreement, in
which event Seller shall assign to Buyer at the Closing (A) any insurance
proceeds payable to Seller on account of such Casualty, in which event Buyer
shall receive as a credit against the Purchase Price the amount of the
deductible portion of Seller's insurance policy, and the reasonable costs, if
any, incurred by Buyer in obtaining such insurance proceeds, or (B) any award
payable to Seller by reason of the Taking, as the case may be; or (ii) terminate
this Agreement effective as of the date such notice of termination is given. If
Buyer fails to give such notice within such 30-day period, then Buyer shall be
deemed to have elected to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Article 7.
The Closing Date shall be deferred, if necessary, to permit Buyer to have the
15-day period following receipt of notice of a Casualty or a Taking to make the
election specified hereinabove. If Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to
this Article 7, then the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer, and neither Seller
nor Buyer shall have any further obligations under this Agreement, except
Buyer's obligation to perform the Continuing Obligations. However,
notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer's delivery of Buyer's work product to
Seller in compliance with Section 4.4 shall be a condition precedent to Buyer's
right to obtain disbursement of the Deposit upon termination of this Agreement
pursuant to this Article 7.



                                      -8-
&lt;PAGE&gt;   9

Nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute an obligation on the part of Seller
to carry or maintain any insurance of any kind whatsoever pertaining to the
Property.

        7.2. Operation of Property. During the period between the Effective Date
of this Agreement and the earlier to occur of (i) the Closing Date or (ii) the
termination of this Agreement, Seller shall (A) generally operate the Property
in the same manner in which Seller operated the Property before the date of this
Agreement, (B) keep Buyer generally apprised of any material discussions or
correspondence between Seller and any existing or prospective tenants of the
Property, (C) not enter into any Lease, service contract or any other agreement
or contract affecting or relating to the Property which will survive the Close
of Escrow or will otherwise affect the use, operation or enjoyment of the
Property after the Close of Escrow without the prior written consent of Buyer,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, (D) continue to carry all
insurance policies carried by Seller with respect to the Property in effect as
of the date of this Agreement continuously in full force and effect, (E)
continue to maintain the Property in the manner in which it was maintained by
Seller as of the Effective Date of this Agreement, and (F) promptly notify Buyer
of any change of which Seller is aware in any condition with respect to the
Property or of any event or circumstances of which Seller is aware which makes
any representation or warranty of Seller to Buyer under this Agreement untrue or
misleading, and of any covenant of Seller under this Agreement which Seller will
be incapable of performing or less likely to perform.

            8.2.3. Condemnation. Seller has not received written notice of any
pending condemnation or eminent domain proceedings affecting the Real Property
or any part thereof.

            8.2.4. Due Authorization. Seller has been duly authorized to execute

firm, corporation, or other entity, with respect to or on account of the Lease.
No such fees, commissions or other compensation shall become due and payable by
Buyer by reason of any existing agreements during the term of the Lease or with
respect to any renewal or extension of the Lease, the leasing of additional
space by any tenant, or the purchase of any space by any tenant.

            8.2.9. Contracts. Other than the management contract between Seller
and the Property Manager, which shall be terminated at the Close of Escrow,

&lt;PAGE&gt;   11

Manager has entered into or has possession of any service contract with respect
to the Property. Buyer is advised that TRW may have concluded such service
contracts with third parties.

            8.2.10. TRW Lease. Seller is not in default in the performance of 
its obligations under the TRW Lease. To Seller's Current Actual Knowledge, (i)
the copy of the TRW Lease which has been delivered to Buyer is true, correct and
complete and constitutes the entire agreement between TRW and Seller regarding
the Property, (ii) all tenant improvements required to be furnished, constructed
or installed under the TRW Lease by Seller from and after its acquisition of the

Lease (or any agreements incorporated therein by reference) and there are no

Property which, with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would
constitute an event of default by TRW under the terms of the TRW Lease, and (iv)
there are no other leases other than the TRW Lease relating to the Property.
Since Seller's acquisition of the Property, the TRW Lease has not been amended,
modified or supplemented except for the Termination Agreement. To Seller's
actual knowledge at the time of its acquisition of the Property, the TRW Lease
was then in full force and effect and without any right to setoff, and to
Seller's actual knowledge since its acquisition of the Property, the TRW Lease
has been and continues to be in full force and effect without any right to
setoff.

            8.2.11. Property Documents. Seller has provided Buyer full access to
the Property Documents prepared by Seller, and to Seller's knowledge, the Due
Diligence materials have not been amended or modified, except as disclosed to
Buyer by Seller in writing.

        8.3. Limitations on Seller's Representations and Warranties. In the
event of any breach by Seller of any of such covenants, representations or
warranties which is discovered prior to the Closing, Buyer's sole remedy shall
be to elect in writing to terminate this Agreement. In no event shall Seller be
liable for any indirect or consequential damages on account of Seller's breach
of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement; and
Seller's total liability to Buyer for any and all breaches of any covenant,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement shall not exceed
$400,000.00. The provisions of this Article 8 shall terminate one year after the
Closing; Seller shall have no liability to Buyer under this Article 8 after such
date.

9. SELLER'S DISCLAIMER; RELEASE AND INDEMNIFICATION OF SELLER.

        9.1. Seller's Disclaimer. Except for the representations and warranties
by Seller set forth in Section 8.2, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the sale
of the Property to Buyer is made without any warranty or representation of any
kind by Seller, either express or implied, with respect to any aspect, portion
or component of the Property, including: (i) the physical condition, nature or
quality of the Property, including the quality of the soils on and under the
Property and the quality of the labor and materials included in any buildings or
other improvements, fixtures, equipment or personal property comprising a
portion of the Property; (ii) the fitness of the Property for any particular
purpose; (iii) the presence or suspected presence of hazardous materials on, in,
under or about the Property (including the soils and groundwater on and under
the Property); or (iv) existing or proposed governmental laws or regulations
applicable



                                      -11-
&lt;PAGE&gt;   12

to the Property, or the further development or change in use thereof, including
environmental laws and laws or regulations dealing with zoning or land use.
Buyer further agrees and acknowledges that, as of the Closing, Buyer shall have
made such feasibility studies, investigations, environmental studies,
engineering studies, inquiries of governmental officials, and all other
inquiries and investigations, which Buyer shall deem necessary to satisfy itself
as to the condition, nature and quality of the Property and as to the
suitability of the Property for Buyer's purposes. Buyer further agrees and
acknowledges that, in purchasing the Property, Buyer shall rely entirely on its
own investigation, examination and inspection of the Property and its analysis
and evaluation of the property documents furnished by Seller to Buyer pursuant
to Subsection 4.1.2, and not upon any representation or warranty of Seller, or
any agent or representative of Seller, which is not set forth in Section 8.2.
THEREFORE, BUYER AGREES THAT, IN CONSUMMATING THE PURCHASE OF THE PROPERTY
PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, BUYER SHALL ACQUIRE THE PROPERTY IN ITS THEN
CONDITION, "AS IS, WHERE IS" AND WITH ALL FAULTS, AND, SUBJECT TO SELLER'S
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTION 8.2, SOLELY IN RELIANCE ON
BUYER'S OWN INVESTIGATION, EXAMINATION, INSPECTION, ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF
THE PROPERTY AND THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER DESCRIBED IN
SECTION 8.2 ABOVE. The agreements and acknowledgments contained in this Section
9.1 constitute a conclusive admission that Buyer, as a sophisticated,
knowledgeable investor in real property, shall acquire the Property solely upon
its own judgment as to any matter germane to the Property or to Buyer's
contemplated use of the Property, and not upon any statement, representation or
warranty by Seller, or any agent or representative of Seller, which is not
expressly set forth in this Agreement. At the Closing, upon the request of
Seller, Buyer shall execute and deliver to Seller a certificate of Buyer
reaffirming the foregoing.

        9.2. Buyer's Release of Seller. Buyer hereby waives, releases and
forever discharges Seller and its officers, directors, employees and agents from
any and all claims, actions, causes of action, demands, liabilities, damages,
costs, expenses or compensation whatsoever, whether direct or indirect, known or
unknown, foreseeable or unforeseeable, which Buyer may have at the Closing or
which may arise in the future on account of or in any way arising out of or
connected with the Property, including: (i) the physical condition, nature or
quality of the Property (including the soils and groundwater on and under the
Real Property); (ii) the presence or release in, under, on or about the Property
(including the soils and groundwater on and under the Real Property) of any
hazardous materials; and (iii) the ownership, management or operation of the
Property. At the Closing, upon the request of Seller, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller a certificate of Buyer reaffirming the foregoing. Buyer hereby waives the
protection of California Civil Code Section 1542, which reads as follows:

                    "A general release does not extend to claims which
                    the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in
                    his favor at the time of executing the release,
                    which if known by him must have materially
                    affected his settlement with the debtor."

Buyer's
Initials:      CC
         --------------



                                      -12-
&lt;PAGE&gt;   13

However, the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.2 shall not serve to release
Seller from any breach of the express representations and warranties set forth
in Section 8.2 or any claims arising out of Seller's fraud.

        9.3. Flood Hazard Zone. Buyer acknowledges that if the Real Property is
located in an area which the Secretary of HUD has found to have special flood
hazards, then pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Program, Buyer will be
required to purchase flood insurance in order to obtain any loan secured by the
Real Property from any federally regulated financial institution or a loan
insured or guaranteed by an agency of the United States government. Buyer shall
have sole responsibility to determine whether the Real Property is located in an
area which is subject to the National Flood Insurance Program.

10. BUYER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

        10.1. General. Buyer makes the covenants, representations and warranties

of this Agreement shall be construed as a whole according to their common

        13.9. Assignment; Successors and Assigns. Buyer shall have no right to
assign this Agreement or any of Buyer's rights hereunder without first having
obtained Seller's prior written consent to such assignment, which Seller may
withhold in its sole and absolute discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller acknowledges and agrees that Buyer may assign Buyer's interest under this
Agreement to an entity (the "Lessor"), who will then lease all of the acquired



                                      -18-
&lt;PAGE&gt;   19

portions of the Property to Buyer, as tenant ("Tenant"), pursuant to a synthetic
lease ("Synthetic Lease") to be executed by Lessor and Tenant, pursuant to which
Tenant shall have the right to construct certain improvements thereon, pursuant
to plans and specifications approved by Lessor and Tenant. The parties
acknowledge that, although the Agreement may be assigned to Lessor, (a) Buyer is
intended to be the ultimate occupant and user of the Real Property, and (b) the
improvements to be constructed thereon are being designed for Buyer's benefit
and to Buyer's specifications. Therefore, the parties acknowledge that, if this
Agreement assigned to Lessor, Buyer is an intended third party beneficiary of
all of Seller's covenants, representations, warranties and obligations under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, whenever
Lessor's consent or approval is a condition or is otherwise required pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, Buyer shall expressly be entitled to withhold its
consent or approval. Subject to the immediately preceding, this Agreement, and
the terms, covenants and conditions herein contained, shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors,
heirs and assigns. In no event shall an assignment by Buyer of this Agreement or
any of Buyer's rights hereunder release Buyer from its obligations under this
Agreement.

        13.10. Exhibits. Each exhibit to which reference is made in this
Agreement is deemed Incorporated into this Agreement in its entirety by such

                                      -19-
&lt;PAGE&gt;   20

the other party (the "Cooperating Party") shall cooperate with the Exchanging
Party, executing such documents and taking such action as may be reasonably
necessary in order to effectuate this transaction as a like-kind exchange;
provided, however, that (i) the Cooperating Party's cooperation hereunder shall

character, including, without limitation, any attorneys' fees, costs or expense
incurred in connection with the review or preparation of documentation in order
to effectuate such like-kind exchange, and the Cooperating Party shall have no
obligation to take title to any real property; (ii) the Exchanging Party shall
assume all risks in connection with the designation, selection and setting of

Party shall bear all costs and expenses in connection with any such exchange
transaction in excess of the costs and expenses which would have otherwise been
incurred in acquiring or selling the Property by means of a straight purchase,
so that the net effect to the Cooperating Party shall be identical to that which
would have resulted had this Agreement closed on a purchase and sale; (iv) any
documents to effectuate such exchange transaction are consistent with the terms
and conditions contained in this Agreement; and (v) the Exchanging Party shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Cooperating Party harmless from any and all
claims, demands, penalties, loss, causes of action, suits, risks, liability,
costs or expenses of any kind or nature (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees) which the Cooperating Party may incur or sustain,
directly or indirectly, related to or in connection with, or arising out of, the
consummation of this transaction as a like-kind exchange as contemplated
hereunder.
