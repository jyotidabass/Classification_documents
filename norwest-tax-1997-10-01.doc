  WHEREAS, pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of the Nebraska
Industrial Development Act, Chapter 13, Article 11, Reissue Revised Statutes of
Nebraska, 1943, as amended (the "Act"), Issuer proposes to finance by the
issuance of industrial revenue bonds of Issuer the cost of acquisition and
improvement of a portion of an addition to Borrower's existing hydraulic pump
manufacturing facilities located in Dodge County, Nebraska and the acquisition
and installation of equipment for such facilities (the "Project"), which
portion of the addition and equipment constitute a "project" within the meaning

Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "Agreement") between Issuer and

pursuant to the Act; and

  WHEREAS, this Tax Regulatory Agreement has been entered into by Issuer,
Borrower and Trustee to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the Income Tax Regulations

Regulatory Agreement must be satisfied;





&lt;PAGE&gt;   5


  NOW THEREFORE, Issuer, Borrower and Trustee hereby agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                  DEFINITIONS

  Section 1.1.  DEFINITIONS.  The following words and phrases shall have the
following meanings.  Any capitalized word or term used herein but not defined
herein shall have the same meaning given in the hereinafter defined Agreement.

  "Abusive Arbitrage Device" means any action which has the effect of (a)
enabling Issuer or Borrower to exploit the difference between taxable and
tax-exempt interest rates to obtain a material financial advantage; and (b)
overburdening the tax-exempt bond market as defined in Section 1.148-10 of the
Regulations.

  "Accounting Method" means both the overall method used to account for the
Gross Proceeds of the Bonds (e.g., the cash method or a modified accrual
method) and the method used to account for or allocate any particular item
within that overall accounting method (e.g., accounting for Investments,
Expenditures, allocations to and from different sources and particular items of
the foregoing).

  "Average Economic Life" means the average reasonably expected economic life
of the Project as defined in Section 147(b) of the Code.

  "Average Maturity" means the average maturity of the Bonds as defined in
Section 147(b) of the Code.

  "Bond Year" means the period commencing October 1 of each calendar year and
terminating on September 30 of the immediately succeeding calendar year during
the term of the Bonds, except that the first Bond Year shall commence on the
Date of Issuance and end on September 30, 1998 (unless a different period is
required by the Regulations or selected by Borrower pursuant to the
Regulations).

  "Bond Yield" means the Yield of the Bonds calculated in accordance with
Section 1.148-4 of the Regulations.

  "Capital Expenditure" means any cost of a type that is for the acquisition,
construction, reconstruction or improvement of land or property of a character
subject to the allowance for depreciation.  For example, costs incurred to
acquire, construct, reconstruct or improve land, buildings and equipment
generally are Capital Expenditures.  Whether an expenditure is a capital
expenditure is determined at the time the expenditure is paid with respect to
the property.  Future changes in law do not affect whether an expenditure is a
capital expenditure.




                                      2
&lt;PAGE&gt;   6


  "Capital Project" means all Capital Expenditures that carry out the
governmental purpose of the Bonds.  For example, a Capital Project may include
Capital Expenditures for one or more building improvements or equipment, plus
related capitalized interest paid or accrued prior to the in-service date for
the Capital Project.

  "Class of Investments" means one of the following, each of which represents a
different Class of Investments:

        (a)   each category of yield restricted Purpose Investment and Program
  Investment, as defined in Section 1.148-l(b), that is subject to a different
  definition of materially higher Yield under Section 1.148-2(d)(2);

        (b)   Yield restricted Nonpurpose Investments; and

        (c)   all other Nonpurpose Investments.

  number of the Bonds are sold to the public);

        (b)   counsel fees (including bond counsel, special tax counsel,
  underwriter's counsel, issuer's counsel, borrower's counsel, trustee's

later than five banking days after the date as of which the allocation of Gross
Proceeds to the Expenditure is made.

  "Date of Issuance" means October 30, 1997.

  "Discharge" means, with respect to the Bonds, the date on which all amounts
due with respect to the Bonds are actually and unconditionally due, if cash is
available at the place of payment, and no interest accrues with respect to such
Bonds after such date.

  "Economic Accrual Method" (also known as the constant interest method or
actuarial method) means the method of computing Yield that is based on the
compounding of interest at the end of each compounding period.

  "Exempt person" means any organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the
Code or a state or a local governmental unit of a state.

  "Expenditure" means a book or record entry which allocates Proceeds of the
Bonds in connection with a Current Outlay of Cash.

  "Fair Market Value" means the price at which a willing buyer would purchase
an Investment from a willing seller in a bona fide, arm's-length transaction.
Fair Market Value generally is determined on the date on which a contract to
purchase or sell the Nonpurpose Investment becomes binding (i.e., the trade
date rather than the settlement date).  Except as otherwise provided in this
definition, an Investment that is not of a type traded on an established
securities market (within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code), is
rebuttably presumed to





                                      4
&lt;PAGE&gt;   8


be acquired or disposed of for a price that is not equal to its Fair Market
Value.  The Fair Market Value of a United States Treasury obligation that is
purchased directly from the United States Treasury is its purchase price.  The
following guidelines shall apply for purposes of determining the Fair Market
Value of the obligations described below:

        (a)   Certificates of Deposit.  The purchase of certificates of deposit
   with fixed interest rates, fixed payment schedules and substantial penalties
   for early withdrawal will be deemed to be an Investment purchased at its Fair
   Market Value on the purchase date if the Yield on the certificate of deposit 
   is not less than:
        
              (i)  the Yield on reasonably comparable direct obligations of the
        United States; and

              (ii) the highest Yield that is published or posted by the 
        provider to be currently available from the provider on reasonably 
        comparable certificates of deposit offered to the public.

        (b)   Guaranteed Investment Contract.  A Guaranteed Investment 
   Contract is a Nonpurpose Investment that has specifically negotiated
   withdrawal or reinvestment provisions and a specifically negotiated interest
   rate, and also includes any agreement to supply.  Investments on two or more
   future dates (e.g., a forward supply contract).  The purchase price of a
   Guaranteed Investment Contract is treated as its Fair Market Value on the
   purchase date if:
        
              (i)    Borrower makes a bona fide solicitation for a specified 
        Guaranteed Investment Contract and receives at least three bona fide 
        bids from providers that have no material financial interest in the 
        issue (e.g., as underwriters or brokers);

              (ii)   Borrower purchases the highest-Yielding Guaranteed 
        Investment Contract for which a qualifying bid is made (determined net 
        of broker's fees);

              (iii)  the Yield on the Guaranteed Investment Contract 
        (determined net of broker's fees) is not less than the Yield then
        available from the provider on reasonably comparable Guaranteed
        Investment Contracts, if any, offered to other persons from a source of
        funds other than gross proceeds of tax-exempt bonds;
        
              (iv)   the determination of the terms of the Guaranteed 
        Investment Contract takes into account as a significant factor
        Borrower's reasonably expected drawdown schedule for the amounts to be
        invested, exclusive of amounts deposited in debt service funds and
        reasonably required reserve or replacement funds;
        
              (v)    the terms of the Guaranteed Investment Contract, including
        collateral security requirements, are reasonable; and
        



                                      5
&lt;PAGE&gt;   9


              (vi) the obligor on the Guaranteed Investment Contract certifies 
        the administrative costs that it is paying (or expects to pay) to third
        parties in connection with the Guaranteed Investment Contract. 

  "Final Computation Date" means the date the Bonds are Discharged.

  "Future Value" means the Value of a Receipt or Payment at the end of any
interval as determined by using the Economic Accrual Method and equals the
Value of that Payment or Receipt when it is paid or received (or treated as
paid or received), plus interest assumed to be earned and compounded over the
period at a rate equal to the Yield on the Bonds, using the same compounding
interval and financial conventions used to compute the Yield on the Bonds.

  "Gross Proceeds" means any Proceeds or Replacement Proceeds of the Bonds.

  "Installment Computation Date" means the last day of the fifth Bond Year and
each succeeding fifth Bond Year as stated in Section 4.1 hereof.

  "Investment" means any Purpose Investment or Nonpurpose Investment, including
any other tax-exempt bond.

  "Investment Proceeds" means any amounts actually or constructively received
from investing Proceeds of the Bonds.

  "Investment-Type Property" means any property, other than property described
in Section 148(b)(2)(A), (B), (C) or (E) of the Code that is held principally
as a passive vehicle for the production of income.  Except as otherwise
provided, a prepayment for property or services is Investment-Type Property if
a principal purpose for prepaying is to receive an Investment return from the
time the prepayment is made until the time payment otherwise would be made. A
prepayment is not Investment-Type Property if:

        (a)   the prepayment is made for a substantial business purpose other 
   than Investment return and the issuer has no commercially reasonable
   alternative to the prepayment, or
        
        (b)   prepayments on substantially the same terms are made by a 
   substantial percentage of persons who are similarly situated to the issuer
   but who are not beneficiaries of tax-exempt financing.
        
  "Issue Price" means, except as otherwise provided, issue price as defined in
Sections 1273 and 1274 of the Code.  Generally, the Issue Price of bonds that
are publicly offered is the first pace at which a substantial amount of the
bonds is sold to the public.  Ten percent is a substantial amount.  The public
does not include bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations
acting in the capacity of underwriters or wholesalers.  The Issue Price does
not change if part of the issue is later sold at a different price.  The Issue
Price of bonds




                                      6
&lt;PAGE&gt;   10


that are not substantially identical is determined separately.  The Issue Price
of bonds for which a bona fide public offering is made is determined as of the
sale date based upon reasonable expectations regarding the initial public
offering price.  If a bond is issued for property, the applicable federal
tax-exempt rate is used in lieu of the federal rate in determining the Issue
Price under Section 1274 of the Code.  The issue price of bonds may not exceed
their Fair Market Value as of the sale date.  With respect to the Bonds, the
Issue Price is $          .

  "Manufacturing Facility" means a Capital Project that is used in the
manufacturing or production of tangible personal property (including the
processing resulting in a change in the condition of such property) including
facilities that are directly related and ancillary to a Manufacturing Facility
if such directly related and ancillary facilities are located on the same site
as the Manufacturing Facility and not more than 25% of the proceeds of an issue
that finances the Manufacturing Facility and such directly related and
ancillary facilities are used to provide such facilities.

  "Net Sale Proceeds" means Sale Proceeds, less the portion of those Sale
Proceeds invested in a reasonably required reserve or replacement fund under
Section 148(d) of the Code and as part of a minor portion under Section 148(e)
of the Code.

  "1954 Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, as in effect
on the effective date of the Code.

  "Nonpurpose Investment" means any security, obligation, annuity contract or
Investment type property as defined in Section 148(b) of the Code, including
"specified private activity bonds" as defined in Section 57(a)(5)(c) of the
Code, but excluding all other obligations the interest on which is excludable
from federal gross income.  The term "Nonpurpose Investment" does not include
Borrower's obligations to make payments to Issuer pursuant to the provisions of
the Agreement.

  "Payments" means, for purposes of computing the Rebate Amount, (a) amounts
actually or constructively paid to acquire a Nonpurpose Investment (or treated
as paid to a commingled fund); (b) for a Nonpurpose Investment that is
allocated to an issue on a date after it is actually acquired (e.g., an
Investment that becomes allocable to Transferred Proceeds or to Replacement
Proceeds) or that becomes subject to the rebate requirement of the Code on a
date after it is actually acquired (e.g., an Investment allocated to a
reasonably required reserve or replacement fund for a construction issue at the
end of the two-year spending period), the Value of that Investment on that
date; (c) for a Nonpurpose Investment that was allocated to an issue at the end
of the preceding computation period, the Value of that Investment at the
beginning of the computation period; (d) on the last day of each Bond Year
during which there are amounts allocated to Gross Proceeds of an issue that are
subject to the rebate requirement of the Code, and on the final maturity date,
a Computation Date Credit; and (e) Yield Reduction Payments on Nonpurpose
Investments made pursuant to Section 1.148-5(c) of the Regulations.  For
purposes of computing the Yield on an Investment (including the Value of the
Investment), Payment means amounts to be actually or constructively paid to
acquire the Investment;




                                      7
&lt;PAGE&gt;   11


provided, however, that payments made by a conduit borrower, such as Borrower,
are not treated as paid until the conduit borrower ceases to receive the
benefit of earnings on those amounts.  Payments on investments, including
Guaranteed Investment Contracts, are adjusted for Qualified Administrative
Costs of acquiring a Nonpurpose Investment.

  "Pre-Issuance Accrued Interest" means amounts representing interest that
accrued on an obligation for a period not greater than one year before the Date
of Issuance but only if those amounts are paid within one year after the Date
of Issuance.

  "Principal User" means a person who is a principal owner, principal lessee, a
principal output purchaser or "other" principal user and any Related Person to
a Principal User.  A principal owner is a person who at any time holds more
than a 10% ownership interest (by value) in a facility or, if no person holds
more than a 10% ownership interest, then the person (or persons in the case of
multiple equal owners) who holds the largest ownership interest in the
facility.  A person is treated as holding an ownership interest if such person
is an owner for federal income tax purposes generally.  A principal lessee is a
person who at any time leases more than 10% of the facility (disregarding
portions used by the lessee under a short-term lease). The portion of a
facility leased to a lessee is generally determined by reference to its fair
rental value.  A short-term lease is one which has a term of one year or less,
taking into account all options to renew and reasonably anticipated renewals.
A principal output purchaser is any person who purchases output of a facility,
unless the total output purchased by such person during each one-year period
beginning with the date such facility is  facility's output during each such
period.  An "other" principal user is a person who enjoys a use of a facility
(other than a short-term use) in a degree comparable to the enjoyment of a
principal owner or a principal lessee, taking into account all the relevant
facts and circumstances, such as the person's participation in control over use
of such facility or its remote or proximate geographic location.

  "Prior Issues" means any issue of tax-exempt obligations (whether or not the
issuer of each issue is the same) to which Section 103(b)(6) of the 1954 Code
or Section 144(a) of the Code applies.

  "Proceeds" means any Sale Proceeds, Investment Proceeds and Transferred
Proceeds of an issue.  Proceeds do not include, however, amounts actually or
constructively received with respect to a Purpose Investment that are properly
allocable to the immaterially higher Yield under Section 1.148-2(d) of the
Regulations or Section 143(g) of the Code or to Qualified Administrative Costs
recoverable under Section 1.148-5(e) of the Regulations.

  "Project"  has the meaning given to such term in the preambles hereto.

  "Purpose Investment" means an Investment that is acquired to carry out the
governmental purpose of an issue.  The Agreement constitute Purpose
Investments.

  "Qualified Administrative Costs" means reasonable, direct administrative
costs, other than carrying costs, such as separately stated brokerage or
selling commissions, but not legal and




                                      8
&lt;PAGE&gt;   12


accounting fees, recordkeeping, custody and similar costs.  General overhead
costs and similar indirect costs of the issuer such as employee salaries and
office expenses and costs associated with computing the Rebate Amount are not
Qualified Administrative Costs.  In general, administrative costs are not
reasonable unless they are comparable to administrative costs that would be
charged for the same Investment or a reasonably comparable Investment if
acquired with a source of funds other than Gross Proceeds of tax-exempt bonds.

  "Qualified Hedging Transaction" means a contract which meets the requirements
of Section 1.148-4(h)(2) of the Regulations.

  "Rebate Amount" means the excess of the Future Value of all Receipts on

Amount additionally includes any penalties and interest on underpayments
reduced for recoveries of overpayments.

  "Rebate Analyst" shall mean the entity chosen by Borrower and Issuer in
accordance with Section 4.6 hereof to determine the amount of required deposits
to the Rebate Fund, if any.

  "Rebate Fund" means the Rebate Fund established pursuant to the Indenture.

  "Receipts" means, for purposes of computing the Rebate Amount, (a) amounts
actually or constructively received from a Nonpurpose Investment (including
amounts treated as received from a commingled fund), such as earnings and
return of principal; (b) for a Nonpurpose Investment that ceases to be
allocated to an issue before its disposition or redemption date (e.g., an
Investment that becomes allocable to Transferred Proceeds of another issue or
that ceases to be allocable to the issue pursuant to the universal cap under
Section 1.148-6 of the Regulations) or that ceases to be subject to the rebate
requirement of the Code on a date earlier than its disposition or redemption
date (e.g., an Investment allocated to a fund initially subject to the rebate
requirement of the Code but that subsequently qualifies as a bona fide debt
service fund), the Value of that Nonpurpose Investment on that date; and (c)
for a Nonpurpose Investment that is held at the end of a computation period,
the Value of that Investment at the end of that period. For purposes of
computing Yield on an Investment, Receipts means amounts to be actually or
constructively received from the Investment, such as earnings and return of
principal (including the Value of an Investment).  Receipts on Investments,
including Guaranteed Investment Contracts, are adjusted (reduced) for Qualified
Administrative Costs.

or (b) such person is a member of the same controlled group of corporations (as
defined in Section 1.563(a) of the Code, except that "more than 50%" shall be
substituted for "at least 80%" each place it appears therein).

  "Replacement Proceeds" means amounts which have a sufficiently direct nexus
to the Bonds or to the governmental purpose of the Bonds to conclude that the
amounts would have been used for that governmental purpose if the Proceeds of
the Bonds were not used or to be used for that governmental purpose, as more
fully defined in Section 1.148-l(c) of the Regulations.

  "Sale Proceeds" means any amounts actually or constructively received from
the sale of the Bonds, including amounts used to pay underwriters' discount or
compensation and accrued interest other than Pre-Issuance Accrued Interest.

  "SLGS" means United States Treasury Certificates of Indebtedness, Notes and
Bonds State and Local Government Series.

the Bonds.

  "Tax Regulatory Agreement" means this Tax Regulatory Agreement.

  "Test-Period Beneficiary" means any person who is an owner or a Principal
User of facilities financed by an issue or issues of tax-exempt obligations
issued under the 1954 Code or the Code during the three-year period beginning
on the later of the date such facilities were placed in service or the date of
issuance for such issue or issues of tax-exempt obligations.  For purposes of
determining whether a person is a Test-Period Beneficiary, all persons who are
Related Persons shall be treated as one person.

  "Transferred Proceeds" means Proceeds of a refunding issue which become
transferred proceeds of a refunding issue and cease to be Proceeds of a prior
issue when Proceeds of the refunding issue discharge any of the outstanding
principal amount of the prior issue.  The amount of Proceeds of the prior issue
that become transferred proceeds of the refunding issue is an amount equal to
the Proceeds of the prior issue on the date of that discharge multiplied by a
fraction:

        (a)   the numerator of which is the principal amount of the prior issue
  discharged with Proceeds of the refunding issue on the date of that
  discharge; and

        (b)   the denominator of which is the total outstanding principal 
   amount of the prior issue on the date immediately before the date of that
   discharge.
        



                                      10
&lt;PAGE&gt;   14


  "Universal Cap" means the Value of all outstanding Bonds.

  "Value" means Value as determined under Section 1.1484(e) of the Regulations
for the Bonds and Value determined under Section 1.148-5(d) of the Regulations
for an Investment.

  "Yield" means, for purposes of determining the Yield on the Bonds, the Yield
computed under the Economic Accrual Method using consistently applied
compounding intervals of not more than one year.  A short first compounding
interval and a short last compounding interval may be used.  Yield is expressed
as an annual percentage rate that is calculated to at least four decimal places
(e.g., 5.2525%).  Other reasonable, standard financial conventions, such as the
30 days per month/360 days per year convention, may be used in computing Yield
but must be consistently applied.  The Yield on an issue that would be a
Purpose Investment (absent Section 148(b)(3)(A) of the Code) is equal to the
Yield on the conduit financing issue that financed that Purpose Investment.
The Yield on a fixed yield issue is the discount rate that, when used in
computing the present Value as of the issue date of all unconditionally payable
payments of principal, interest and fees for qualified guarantees on the issue
and amounts reasonably expected to be paid as fees for qualified guarantees on
the issue, produces an amount equal to the present Value, using the same
discount rate, of the aggregate issue price of bonds of the issue as of the
issue date.  In the case of obligations purchased or sold at a substantial
discount or premium, the Regulations prescribe certain special Yield
calculation rules.  For purposes of determining the Yield on an Investment, the
Yield computed under the Economic Accrual Method, using the same compounding
interval and financial conventions used to compute the Yield on the Bonds.

  The Yield on an Investment allocated to the Bonds is the discount rate that,
when used in computing the present Value as of the date the Investment is first
allocated to the issue of all unconditionally payable receipts from the
Investment, produces an amount equal to the present Value of all
unconditionally payable payments for the Investment.  The Yield on an
Investment shall not be adjusted by any hedging transaction entered into in
connection with such Investment unless Issuer, Trustee and Borrower have
received an opinion of Special Tax Counsel that such an adjustment is permitted
by the Regulations.  Yield shall be calculated separately for each Class of
Investments.

  "Yield Reduction Payment" means a payment to the United States with respect
to an Investment which is treated as a Payment for that Investment that reduces
the Yield on that Investment in accordance with Section 1.148-5(c) of the
Regulations.  Yield Reduction Payments include Rebate Amounts paid to the
United States

  Section 1.2.  RELIANCE ON BORROWER'S INFORMATION.  Special Tax Counsel,
Trustee and Issuer shall be permitted to rely upon the contents of any
certification, document or instructions provided pursuant to this Tax
Regulatory Agreement and shall not be responsible or liable in any way for the
accuracy of their contents or the failure of Borrower to deliver any required
information.

                the Bonds earlier than shown in the Yield computations for the 
                Bonds pursuant to this Article IV.

         Section 4.2.  ARBITRAGE COMPLIANCE.  Borrower and Issuer acknowledge
that the continued exclusion of interest on the Bonds from gross income of the
recipients thereof for purposes of federal income taxation depends, in part,
upon compliance with the arbitrage limitations imposed by Section 148 of the
Code, including the rebate requirement described in Section 4.3 below.
Borrower and Issuer hereby agree and covenant that they shall not permit at any
time or times any of the Proceeds of the Bonds or other funds of Borrower to be
used, directly or indirectly, to acquire any asset or obligation, the
acquisition of which would cause the Bonds to be "arbitrage bonds" for purposes
of Section 148 of the Code.  Borrower further agrees and covenants that it
shall do and perform all acts and things necessary in order to ensure that the
requirements of Section 148 of the Code and the Regulations are met.  To that
end, Borrower shall retain, at its own expense, a Rebate Analyst to make such
determinations and calculations as may be necessary in order to ensure that
Borrower takes the actions described in Sections 4.2 through 4.6 hereof with
respect to the Investment of Gross Proceeds on deposit in the funds and
accounts established under the Indenture.  If Borrower fails to retain such a
Rebate Analyst, Trustee shall, upon being notified in writing of such failure,
at Borrower's expense, retain such a Rebate Analyst.  Borrower shall make the
required transfers and dispositions described in Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4
hereof, and Trustee may rely upon information provided by Borrower.

         Section 4.3.  CALCULATION OF REBATE AMOUNT.  (a) Section 148(f) of the
Code requires the payment to the United States of the Rebate Amount.  Except as
provided below, all funds or accounts treated as containing Gross Proceeds, are
subject to this rebate requirement.

         (b)     In accordance with the requirements set out in the Code,
Borrower may create, as needed, a Rebate Fund to be used as provided in this
Section.

                 (i)      On or before 25 days following each Computation Date
         an amount shall be deposited to the Rebate Fund from source or sources
         stated in such direction so that the balance of the Rebate Fund shall
         equal the aggregate Rebate Amount as of such determination date.

                 (ii)     Amounts deposited in the Rebate Fund shall be
         invested in accordance with the Agreement of Borrower.

                 (iii)    All money at any time deposited in the Rebate Fund
         shall be held by Borrower, to the extent required by this Tax
         Regulatory Agreement, for payment to the United States of America of
         the Rebate Amount.  All amounts deposited into or on deposit in the
         Rebate Fund shall be governed by this Tax Regulatory Agreement.




                                      18
&lt;PAGE&gt;   22


                 (iv)     For purposes of crediting amounts to the Rebate Fund
         or withdrawing amounts from the Rebate Fund, Nonpurpose Investments
         shall be valued in the manner provided in this Article.

         (c)     In order to meet the rebate requirement of Section 148(f) of
the Code, the Rebate Analyst described in Section 4.6 hereof and Borrower
agrees and covenants to take the following actions:

                 (i)      For each Investment of amounts held with respect to
         the Bonds pursuant to the Indenture, Borrower shall record the
         purchase date of such Investment, its purchase price, accrued interest
         due on its purchase date, its face amount, its coupon rate, its Yield,
         the frequency of its interest payment, its disposition price, accrued
         interest due on its disposition date and its disposition date.
         Borrower or the Rebate Analyst retained by Borrower shall determine
         the Fair Market Value for such Investments and the Yield thereon as
         may be required by the Regulations.  The Yield for an Investment shall
         be calculated by using the method set forth in the Regulations.

                 (ii)     For each Computation Date specified in paragraph
         (iii) below, the Rebate Analyst shall compute the Yield on the Bonds
         as required by the Regulations based on the definition of issue price
         contained in Section 148(h) of the Code and the Regulations. The Yield
         on the Bonds shall be calculated by Borrower at such time in order to
         comply with this Tax Regulatory Agreement and the Regulations based on
         the definitions of issue price contained in Section 148(h) of the Code
         using payments or prepayments of the principal of, premium, if any,
         and interest on the Bonds required by the Regulations.  For purposes
         of this Tax Regulatory Agreement the initial offering price to the
         public (not including bond houses and brokers, or similar persons or
         organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters or wholesalers)
         at which a substantial amount of the Bonds were sold is the Issue
         Price.  Any reasonable amounts paid for credit enhancement have been
         and may generally be treated as interest on the Bonds for purposes of
         Yield computation to the extent permitted by the Regulations.

                 (iii)    Subject to the special rules set forth in paragraphs
         (iv) and (v) below, the Rebate Analyst shall determine the amount of
         earnings received on all Nonpurpose Investments described in paragraph
         (i) above, for each Computation Date.  In addition, where Nonpurpose
         Investments are retained by Borrower after retirement of the Bonds,
         any unrealized gains or losses as of the date of retirement of the
         Bonds must be taken into account in calculating the earnings on such
         Nonpurpose Investments to the extent required by the Regulations.

                 (iv)     In determining the Rebate Amount computed pursuant to
         this Section, (A) all earnings on any bona fide debt service fund
         shall not be taken into account for any Bond Year during which the
         gross earnings of such funds total less than $100,000, (B) the
         Universal Cap applicable to the Bonds pursuant to Section
         1.148-6(b)(2) of the Regulations shall be taken into account, (C) all
         of Borrower's elections and other choices




                                      19
&lt;PAGE&gt;   23


         set forth in Section 4.1 hereof shall be taken into account and (D)
         all spending exceptions to rebate met by Borrower shall be taken into
         account.

                 (v)      For each Computation Date specified in paragraph
         (iii) above, the Rebate Analyst shall calculate for each Investment
         described in paragraphs (i) and (iii) above, an amount equal to the
         earnings which would have been received on such Investment at an
         interest rate equal to the Yield on the Bonds as described in
         paragraph (ii) above.  The method of calculation shall follow that set
         forth in the Regulations.

                 (vi)     For each Computation Date, the Rebate Analyst shall
         determine the amount of earnings received on all Investments held in
         the Rebate Fund for the Computation Date The method of calculation
         shall follow that set forth in the Regulations.

                 (vii)    For each Computation Date, the Rebate Analyst shall
         calculate the Rebate Amount, by any appropriate method to be described
         in the Code and Regulations applicable or which becomes applicable to
         the Bonds.  The determination of the Rebate Amount shall account for
         the amount (to be rounded down to the nearest multiple of $100) equal
         to the sum of all amounts determined in paragraph (iii), all amounts
         determined in paragraphs (v) and (vi), and less any amount which has
         previously been paid to the United States pursuant to Section 4.4
         below.  The Rebate Analyst shall notify Trustee of the Rebate Amount.

                 (viii)   If the Rebate Amount exceeds the amount on deposit in
         the Rebate Fund, Borrower shall immediately deposit such amount into
         the Rebate Fund.

         Section 4.4.     PAYMENT TO UNITED STATES.  (a) Not later than 60 days
after each Installment Computation Date (or such longer period as may be
permitted by the Regulations), Borrower shall pay to the United States an
amount that, when added to the Future Value as of such Computation Date of
previous rebate payments made for the Bonds, equals at least 90% of the Rebate
Amount required to be on deposit in the Rebate Fund as of such payment date.
No later than 60 days after the Final Computation Date Borrower shall pay to
the United States an amount that, when added to the Future Value as of such
Computation Date of previous rebate payments made for the Bonds, equals at
least 100% of the balance remaining in the Rebate Fund.

         (b)     Borrower shall mail each payment of an installment to the
Internal Revenue Service Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19255.  Each
payment shall be accompanied by Internal Revenue Form 8038-T, and, if
necessary, a statement summarizing the determination of the Rebate Amount.

         (c)     If on any Computation Date, the aggregate amount earned on
Nonpurpose Investments in which the Gross Proceeds of the Bonds are invested is
less than the amount that would have been earned if the obligations had been
invested at a rate equal to the Yield on the




                                      20
&lt;PAGE&gt;   24


Bonds as determined in Section 4.3, such deficit may at the written request of
Borrower be withdrawn from the Rebate Fund and paid to Borrower or as Borrower
shall direct.  Borrower may direct that any overpayment of rebate may be
recovered from any Rebate Amount previously paid to the United States pursuant
to Section 1.148-3(i) of the Regulations.

         (d)     Borrower shall also pay any penalty or interest on
underpayments of Rebate Amount not paid in a timely manner pursuant to this Tax
Regulatory Agreement, the Code and the Regulations.

         calculations until six years after the retirement of the last
         obligation of the Bonds.

         Section 4.6.  REBATE ANALYST.  (a) Borrower shall appoint a Rebate
Analyst and any successor Rebate Analyst for the Bonds reasonably acceptable to
Issuer, subject to the conditions set forth in this Section.  The Rebate
Analyst and each successor Rebate Analyst shall signify its acceptance of the
duties imposed upon it hereunder by a written instrument of acceptance
delivered to Issuer and Borrower under which such Rebate Analyst will agree to
discharge its duties pursuant to this Tax Regulatory Agreement in a manner
consistent with prudent industry practice.

         (b)     The Rebate Analyst may at any time resign and be discharged of
the duties and obligations created by this Tax Regulatory Agreement by giving
notice to Issuer and Borrower.  Borrower and Issuer shall, upon the resignation
or removal of the Rebate Analyst, appoint a successor Rebate Analyst.

by Section 148(f) of the Code.  The charges and fees for such Rebate Analyst
shall be paid by Borrower upon presentation of an invoice for services rendered
in connection therewith.
