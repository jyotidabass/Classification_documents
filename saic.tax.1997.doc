                             TAX SHARING AGREEMENT


      This TAX SHARING AGREEMENT ("Agreement"), by and between SCIENCE
APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation,
("SAIC"), and NETWORK SOLUTIONS, INC., a Delaware corporation,
("Network Solutions").

      WHEREAS, Network Solutions anticipates that it will offer to the public
2,300,000 shares of its Class A voting common stock which will represent
approximately 1.8% of the vote and 15.5% of the value of the total issued and
outstanding Network Solutions stock ("Stock");

      WHEREAS, after such public offering, SAIC will own all of the Class B
stock which represents approximately 98.2% of the vote and 84.5% of the value of
the total issued and outstanding shares of Stock and, accordingly, Network
Solutions will continue as a member of an affiliated group (within the meaning
of section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code")) of which SAIC is the common parent corporation (the "Group") and SAIC
will continue to include Network Solutions in its consolidated federal income
tax returns (in accordance with Code sections 1501 and 1502);

      WHEREAS, section 1552 of the Code provides that earnings and profits of
the members of an affiliated group are to be determined by allocating the tax
liability of the group for a particular taxable year among the members of the
group in accordance with whichever of the several allowable methods the group
shall have adopted in the group's consolidated federal income tax returns; and

      WHEREAS, the parties hereto deem it equitable that, with respect to each
taxable year for which a consolidated or combined return is filed on behalf of
the Group, Network Solutions shall pay SAIC an amount equal to its Separate
Company Tax Liability (as hereinafter defined); and

      WHEREAS, the parties hereto wish to provide for the treatment of various
other matters that may arise as a result of the filing of consolidated returns,
and the parties wish to set forth in this Agreement the agreement between SAIC
and Network Solutions with respect to the allocation and settlement of the
federal, state and local taxes of the Group with respect to each taxable period
ending on or after the date hereof during which Network Solutions is included
in the affiliated group of which SAIC is the common parent (the "Affiliation
Periods").

      Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained
herein, the parties agree as follows:

      SECTION 1.  FILING OF RETURNS.  With respect to each Affiliation Period,
SAIC shall file, and Network Solutions shall agree to join in the filing of,
consolidated federal income tax returns on behalf of the Group.  Network
Solutions shall execute and file such consents,





                                     -1-
&lt;PAGE&gt;   2
elections and other documents as SAIC reasonably requests with respect to the
filing of the Group's consolidated federal income tax returns, and shall,
consistent with Section 4 hereof, timely provide to SAIC such information as
may be necessary for the filing of such returns or for the determination of
amounts due under this Agreement.  Network Solutions acknowledges and agrees
that the rights conferred upon SAIC in connection with the filing of the
Group's returns include, without limitation, the right to reasonably determine
the allocation of income (or loss) of SAIC and any other subsidiary between the
last Affiliation Period and the next taxable period.  Network Solutions shall
file all federal, state, local and foreign tax returns with respect to all
periods for which Network Solutions does not join SAIC in filing a consolidated
or combined return and Network Solutions shall be responsible for the payment
of all taxes in connection therewith.  Network Solutions shall file any such
tax returns in a manner consistent with the manner in which SAIC filed its
returns for Affiliation Periods (except as required by law or to the extent any
inconsistency would not adversely affect the returns of the Group).

      SECTION 2.  TAX PAYMENTS.

      (a)  Due Dates.  Except as otherwise provided herein: (i) Network
Solutions will pay to SAIC the amount due SAIC, as determined under Section
2(b) below, no later than the due date for the filing of any federal income tax
return of the Group that includes Network Solutions; and (ii) SAIC will pay
Network Solutions the amount due Network Solutions, as determined under Section
2(c) below, no later than the due date for the filing of any federal income tax
return of the Group that includes Network Solutions; provided, however, that no
later than each estimated federal income tax payment date of the Group for
which the Group actually incurs a federal income tax liability with respect to
an Affiliation Period, Network Solutions shall pay to SAIC the minimum amount
required to be paid to avoid the imposition of any penalties or additions to
tax under the Code, determined on the same basis as the total amount due for an
Affiliation Period under Section 2(b).  The amount of any overpayment or
underpayment pursuant to this Section 2(a) shall be credited against, or added
to, as the case may be, the amount otherwise required to be paid for the period
within which the amount of such overpayment or underpayment first becomes
reasonably ascertainable.  The settlements may be satisfied by check, wire
transfer or through intercompany accounts as the parties may mutually agree.

      (b)  Amount Due to SAIC.  Network Solutions shall pay SAIC in the time
and manner described in Section 2(a) an amount equal to any "Separate Company
Tax Liability" of Network Solutions.  The "Separate Company Tax Liability" for
any Affiliation Period shall be the amount, if any, of the federal income tax
liability (including, without limitation, liability for any penalty, fine,
additions to tax, interest, minimum tax and other items applicable to a
subsidiary in connection with the determination of the subsidiary's tax
liability) which Network Solutions would have incurred had it filed a separate
federal income tax return for such Affiliation Period, computed in the manner
prescribed in Income Tax Regulation section 1.1552-1(a)(2)(ii), except that no
carryforward or carryback of losses or credits shall be allowed.





                                     -2-
&lt;PAGE&gt;   3
      The Separate Company Tax Liability for Network Solutions shall be
determined by SAIC (with the cooperation and assistance of Network Solutions)
in a manner consistent with (i) general tax accounting principles, (ii) the
Code and regulations thereunder and (iii) so long as a reasonable legal basis
exists therefor, prior custom and practice.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, Separate Company Tax Liability shall be construed to include
Network Solutions' federal or applicable state income or franchise tax
liability, including any applicable alternative minimum tax liability, but only
to the extent that such alternative minimum tax liability is incurred by the
consolidated (combined) filing group, as the case may be (computed without
taking into account any net operating loss carryover or carryback which has
been used by the Group to reduce its consolidated tax liability but including
any liability attributable to any items of recapture) determined for tax
reporting purposes on a quarterly basis.

      In addition, transactions or items between SAIC and Network Solutions
that are deferred under the federal income tax return shall also be deferred
for purposes of this Agreement until such time as they are restored or
otherwise triggered into income under the Code or regulations.

      (c)  Amount due to Network Solutions.  In the event Network Solutions
does not have Separate Company Tax Liability for an Affiliation Period, but
instead either incurs net losses or credits for such period, SAIC shall pay
Network Solutions in the time and manner prescribed in Section 2(a) the amount
by which the Group's federal income tax liability for such period is actually
reduced by reason of the actual use of such losses or credits in the Group's
federal income tax return attributable to Network Solutions.

      In the event Network Solutions incurs any tax losses or tax credits that,
as permitted under the Code and the regulations, are carried back or forward to
one or more Affiliation Periods, SAIC shall pay Network Solutions an amount
equal to the amount by which the Group's federal income tax liability is
actually reduced by reason of the actual use of such carried over losses or
credits in the Group's federal income tax return.  Any payment from SAIC to
Network Solutions required on account of such carryover shall be paid within 15
days of the date the benefit of the carryover is realized by SAIC by reason of
the receipts of a refund or credit of taxes.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, Network Solutions will relinquish the
carryback of any net operating losses under section 172(b)(3) of the Code (or
any successor provision) to Affiliation Periods unless SAIC expressly agrees to
such carryback; further, Network Solutions will not be entitled to any payments
under this Agreement or otherwise if it (or any Subsidiary, as defined in
Section 5) sustains losses or credits in taxable periods that are eligible to
be carried back to Affiliation Periods, unless (i) SAIC, in its sole and
absolute discretion, elects to file a claim for refund with respect to such
carryback items or agrees to permit Network Solutions to file such claim, (ii)
SAIC actually receives a refund or credit of taxes with respect thereto (in
which event, any other provision herein notwithstanding, Network Solutions
shall be entitled to the amount determined in the previous paragraph including
any interest actually paid by the taxing authority attributable thereto less
the amount reasonably determined by SAIC to be equal to the present value
(determined at the





                                     -3-
&lt;PAGE&gt;   4
then applicable short-term federal rate under the Code) of any tax benefit of
the Group that may be deferred or eliminated and any future increase in tax
liability of the Group that may be incurred because of such carryback) and
(iii) SAIC is indemnified by Network Solutions in a form satisfactory to SAIC
for its reasonable costs and expenses incurred in pursuing such refund (which
costs shall be paid by Network Solutions regardless of whether any refund is
obtained).  Any subsequent adjustment to a loss or credit carryback shall be
treated as an adjustment to tax liability in Section 3 below.

      (d)  Paying Agent.  SAIC agrees to make all required payments to the
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") of the consolidated federal income tax
liability, if any, of the Group.

      SECTION 3.  ADJUSTMENTS TO TAX LIABILITY.

      (a)  Adjustment-Related Payments.  If the consolidated federal income tax
liability of the Group or any of its members is adjusted for any taxable period
for any reason other than a loss or credit carryback to the extent already
provided for in Section 2(c), whether by means of an amended return, judicial
decision, claim for refund or tax audit by the IRS, Separate Company Tax
Liability or the amount of tax benefits realized by the Group by reason of the
use of Network Solutions losses or credit shall be recomputed to give effect to
such adjustment, and the amount of any payments due under Section 2 hereof
shall be appropriately adjusted.  Any additional payment between SAIC and
Network Solutions required by reason of such recomputed Separate Company Tax
Liability or Group tax refund or credit shall include an allocable share of any
refunded interest received from the IRS, if applicable, or deficiency interest,
penalties and additions to tax, if applicable (such allocable share of refunded
interest or deficiency interest, penalties and additions to tax shall be paid
or charged, respectively, to Network Solutions to the extent such amount
relates to (i) reduced Group tax liability due to decreased Separate Company
Tax Liability or increased Group tax refund or credit resulting from increased
use of Network Solutions losses or credits, on the one hand, or (ii) increased
Group tax liability due to increased Separate Company Tax Liability or
decreased Group tax benefits arising from decreased use of Network Solutions
losses or credits, on the other hand).

      (b)  Timing of Payments.  Any payments to be paid to or by Network
Solutions under this Section 3 shall be made on or before the earliest to occur
of (i) a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction that is not subject to
further judicial review (by appeal or otherwise) and that has become final,
(ii) the expiration of the time for (A) filing a claim for refund or (B)
instituting suit in respect to a claim for refund disallowed in whole or in
part by the IRS or for which the IRS took no action, (iii) the execution of a
closing agreement under section 7121 of the Code or the acceptance by the IRS
or its counsel of an offer in compromise under section 7122 of the Code (or any
successor provisions), (iv) the expiration of 30 days after (A) IRS acceptance
of a Waiver of Restrictions on Assessment and Collection of Deficiency in Tax
on Overassessment on Internal Revenue Form 870 or 870-AD (or any successor or
comparable form), or (B) the expiration of the ninety-day period after receipt
of the statutory notice of deficiency resulting in immediate assessment, unless
within such 30 days SAIC notifies Network Solutions of its intent to





                                     -4-
&lt;PAGE&gt;   5
attempt recovery of any relevant amounts paid under the waiver by filing a
timely claim for refund or Network Solutions has requested that SAIC attempt
recovery of relevant amounts paid and complied with and subject to Section 7
hereof, (v) the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to the
relevant period or (vi) any other event the parties reasonably agree is a final
determination of the tax liability at issue.

      SECTION 4.  BOOKS AND RECORDS.  SAIC and Network Solutions agree that the
preparation of the federal income and other tax returns, amended returns,
claims for refund or IRS examination or litigation relating to the foregoing
may require the use of records and information that is within the exclusive
possession and control of either of SAIC and Network Solutions.  SAIC and
Network Solutions will provide such records, information and assistance (which
may include making employees of any of the foregoing entities available to
provide additional information and explanation material hereunder) as are
requested by SAIC or Network Solutions, as the case may be, during regular
business hours, in connection with any of the developments described in the
preceding sentence; provided, however, that Network Solutions shall provide
SAIC with all information necessary to enable SAIC to file the Group
consolidated federal income tax return for each Affiliation Period as soon as
practicable (but in no event later than five months) after the last day of such
Affiliation Period, and on the date the Group federal income tax returns that
include Network Solutions are filed SAIC shall provide Network Solutions with
those portions of such returns relating to Network Solutions.  Each of the
parties agrees that it shall retain, until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (including extensions), copies of any tax returns for
any Affiliation Periods and for any other periods that might be subject to
adjustment under this Agreement, and supporting work schedules and other
records or information, that may be relevant to the tax returns of the parties
hereto, and that it will not destroy or otherwise dispose of such records and
information without providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to
review and copy such records and information.

      SECTION 5.  ASSIGNMENT.  This Agreement shall not be transferable or
assignable by either party hereto without the prior written consent of the
other party hereto.  The rights and obligations hereunder of the parties shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective
permitted successors and assigns.  This Agreement shall be binding upon each
corporation in which Network Solutions owns, directly or indirectly, stock
meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) of the Code (a "Subsidiary"),
whether or not Network Solutions owns stock in such corporation upon the
execution of this Agreement or at any time during Affiliation Periods, and
Network Solutions shall cause each such corporation as soon as practicable to
assent formally to the terms hereof.  Except as herein otherwise specifically
provided, nothing in this Agreement shall confer any right or benefit upon any
person or entity other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

      SECTION 6.  DISPUTES.  Any dispute concerning the interpretation of a
Section or amount of payment due under this Agreement shall be resolved by
SAIC's regular outside accounting firm, whose judgment shall be conclusive and
binding on the parties and who shall act in consultation with SAIC's tax
counsel.





                                     -5-
&lt;PAGE&gt;   6
      SECTION 7.  TAX CONTROVERSIES.  If any party receives notice of a tax
examination, audit or challenge involving amounts subject to this Agreement,
such party shall timely notify the other party of the information and shall
provide the other party a written copy of any relevant letters, forms or
schedules received from the IRS or otherwise in its possession and shall
provide notice and information relating to all material proceedings in
connection therewith.  In any audit conference or other proceeding with the IRS
or in any judicial proceedings concerning the determination of the federal
income tax liabilities of the Group or any of its members, including Network
Solutions, the Group and each of its members shall be represented by persons
selected by SAIC.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 6, the
settlement and terms of settlement of any issues relating to such proceeding
shall be in the sole discretion of SAIC, and Network Solutions hereby appoints
SAIC as its agent for the purpose of proposing and concluding any such
settlement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no
event shall SAIC be obligated to file any amended returns or claims for refund
with respect to Affiliation Periods.

      SECTION 8.  STATE AND LOCAL TAXES.  To the extent appropriate, all
provisions of this Agreement shall apply with the same force and effect to any
state or local income tax liabilities that are computed on a combined,
consolidated or unitary method; provided, however, that appropriate adjustments
shall be made to the provisions hereof, including computation of Separate
Company Tax Liability, with respect to any period within an Affiliation Period
during which Network Solutions or Network Solutions items were not included on
a return of SAIC or other members of the Group, or were included on a return of
members of the Group other than SAIC.

      SECTION 9.  APPORTIONMENT FOR TAX PURPOSES.  For each taxable year of the
Group, the group's consolidated federal tax liability shall be apportioned for
purposes of computing earnings and profits in accordance with the method
provided in section 1552(a)(2) of the Code and Income Tax Regulations section
1.1552-1(a)(2).

      SECTION 10.  EXCESS LOSS ACCOUNT INCOME.  If the amount of any excess
loss account (as defined in Income Tax Regulations sections 1.1502-19(a) and
1.1502-32(a)(3)(ii)) in the stock of a Subsidiary is required for any reason to
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the Group, Network
Solutions or other applicable Subsidiary shall pay to SAIC the amount of any
income or franchise tax liability resulting from such inclusion.  Such payment
shall be made within ten (10) days following the end of the taxable year in
which such inclusion occurred.

      SECTION 11.  ADDITIONAL GROUP MEMBERS.  If at any time SAIC or Network
Solutions acquires or forms one or more subsidiary corporations that are
includible corporations in the Group consolidated federal income tax returns,
SAIC or Network Solutions, as the case may be, shall cause such corporations to
become subject to this Agreement and all references to Subsidiary or
Subsidiaries herein, where appropriate, shall thereafter be interpreted to
refer to Network Solutions and such Subsidiaries as a group.





                                  -6-              
&lt;PAGE&gt;   7
      SECTION 12.  INDEMNITY.  If any party to this Agreement other than SAIC

      SECTION 13.  MISCELLANEOUS.

      (a)  Injunction.  The parties acknowledge that irreparable damage would

      (b)  Severability.  If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void
or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions set forth herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.  It is hereby stipulated and

same result as that contemplated by such term, provision, covenant or
restriction.

      (c)  Further Assurances.  Subject to the provisions hereof, the parties
hereto shall make, execute, acknowledge and deliver such other instruments and

&lt;PAGE&gt;   8
      (e)  Waivers.  No failure or delay on the part of the parties in
exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right or power.  No modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement
nor consent to any departure by the parties therefrom shall in any event be

regulations or the interpretation thereof by any court of law or other
governing body having jurisdiction subsequent to the date of this Agreement,
performance of any provision of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
thereby shall become impracticable or impossible, the parties hereto shall use
their best efforts to find and employ an alternative means to achieve the same
or substantially the same result as that contemplated by such provision.

      (h)  Confidentiality.  Subject to any contrary requirement of law and the
right of each party to enforce its rights hereunder in any legal action, each
party agrees that it shall keep strictly confidential, and shall cause its
employees and agents to keep strictly confidential, any information which it or
any of its agents or employees may acquire pursuant to, or in the course of
performing its obligations under, any provision of this Agreement; provided,

information which (i) at the time of disclosure was in the public domain not as
a result of acts by the receiving party or (ii) was in the possession of the
receiving party at the time of disclosure.

      (i)  Headings.  Descriptive headings are for convenience only and shall
not control or affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this
Agreement.

      (j)  Counterparts.  For the convenience of the parties, any number of
counterparts of this Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto, and each
such executed counterpart shall be, and shall be deemed to be, an original
instrument.

      (k)  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in

date hereof and shall continue, unless earlier terminated by mutual agreement
of the parties, until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including extensions) for the Affiliation Period (the "Final Date"); provided
that the provisions of Sections 1, 2 and 3 shall continue to apply after the
Final Date only to the extent they deal with matters relevant to tax periods
which end on or before such Final Date or which begin prior to and end after

      (o)  Modifications.  This Agreement may be modified or amended only
pursuant to an instrument in writing executed by all the parties hereto.
